# MedTechInnovators: Medical Facility Digital Twin

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic digital twin system for simulating and visualizing patient flow through different departments in a medical facility. It incorporates real-time data generation, quality checks, and a simple visualization to track the movement of patients across departments.

The goal is to showcase foundational data management, real-time simulation, and visualization capabilities as a part of understanding and implementing a digital twin system.

## Features
- Real-Time Data Collection: Simulates patient arrivals and movements using Python.
- Data Quality Checks: Validates patient data for accuracy and flags any inconsistencies.
- Visualization: Provides a graphical representation of patient flow in different departments.

## System Architecture

1. Input:
    - Simulated patient data (randomly generated in real time).
2. Processing:
    - Validates the data for missing fields or incorrect department names.
    - Stores validated data in a .csv file for further analysis.
3. Output:
    - Real-time bar charts showing the number of patients in each department.

## Key Algorithms

1. Data Generation:

    - Randomly generates patient data with unique IDs, timestamps, and assigned departments.

    - Simulates real-time behavior using Pythonâ€™s time.sleep().

2. Data Validation:

    - Checks for missing or incorrect patient records.

    - Validates department names and logs invalid entries.

    - Outputs clean data for visualization.

3. Data Visualization:

    - Displays patient distribution using bar charts.

    - Implements real-time updates for a dynamic view of patient flow.
